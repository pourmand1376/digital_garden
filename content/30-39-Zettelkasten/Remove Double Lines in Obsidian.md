title: Remove Double Lines in Obsidian
publish: true

Sometimes when you copy a new markdown, obsidian will paste some new lines. This is a solution based on templater plugin which resolves this issue.

First create a new file named `remove-double-lines.md`. Then paste this content into it:

```
<%*
app.vault.process(app.workspace.getActiveFile(), contents => contents.replace(/\n\s*\n/g, '\n'))
-%>
```

This basically removes all double newlines.

Original Pasted Content (which does that with two '\n\n')
```
<%*
// Clean up multiple line breaks in a note
app.vault.process(app.workspace.getActiveFile(), contents => contents.replace(/\n\s*\n/g, '\n\n'))
-%>
```
